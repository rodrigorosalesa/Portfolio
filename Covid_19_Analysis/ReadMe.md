# Impact of COVID-19: Preparing for Future Pandemics and the Effect in the Stock Market

Final project for the courses **603: Statistical Modelling with Data** and **604: Working with at Scale**, for the **Master´s in Data Science and Analytics** imparted by the **University of Calgary**, in which we showcased all the knowledge acquired in both courses. 

We decided to analyse the impact that Covid-19 had in the population and economical sector as in our increasingly interconnected world, contagious diseases can be transmitted over vast distances remarkably easily which can then cause devastation on personal, societal, and worldwide scales.

<br>

For *604* we used **Python** and the plan we elaborated was:
1. Data Gathering
    - Import libraries and datasets
2. Data Cleaning
    - Dealing with Null values
3. Data Wrangling
    - Feature engineering
4. Data Exploration
    - Data analysis
6. Conclusions

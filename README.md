<br>

I have a strong background as a Data Analyst and some experience as a Data Engineer. Currently I am doing my Master´s in Data Science at the University of Calgary. I am very hard working, and I am always eager to learn new things. 

This is my Data Science Portfolio where I showcase my work as a Data Scientist/Data Analyst/Data Engineer.

## **Projects**

### **[1. Sentiment Analysis of Reddit Posts](Reddit_NLP\Results.pdf)**
The internet has revolutionized communication, learning, socializing, and business, allowing people to connect regardless of distance and time. Reddit, known as the "front page of the internet," is a popular online community with subreddits covering a vast range of topics. 

This project aims to explore natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, interact with and extract data from Reddit's API, and analyze the data for meaningful insights. NLP is a computer technology that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language, making it easier for people to interact with technology. Reddit provides a robust source of data and has a Python package, PRAW, for easier extraction of data from its API. The focus of this project is on the subreddits of major Canadian cities to understand the distribution of topics and the sentiment behind them.

### **[2. Time Series: Spanish Wine Production](Time_Series_Wine_Production\ReadMe.md)**
Wine holds a significant role in society, not only for its taste but also as a thriving economic sector. Wine production generates billions of dollars annually, and its association with tourism further contributes to local economies by creating jobs and generating revenue. Wine also plays a social role by fostering relationships and being a part of celebrations and special occasions.

Time series analysis, proves valuable in modeling trends and predicting future values of temporal data. Techniques such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks can be employed to analyze and forecast crop production trends. Each method offers advantages and limitations based on data structure, model complexity, and forecasting requirements.

### **[3. Impact of COVID-19: Preparing for Future Pandemics and the Effect in the Stock Market](Covid_19_Analysis\ReadMe.md)**
The domain of our project covers economic and healthcare-related indicators of the wellbeing of countries during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In particular, we will be examining data related to the prevalence and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the governmental and societal measures taken to reduce the spread of the disease, and the performance of key stock market indices during the pandemic. 

This is an important topic of study because, in our increasingly interconnected world, contagious diseases can be transmitted over vast distances remarkably easily. Even small, remote outbreaks of diseases anywhere in the world can swiftly turn into a global pandemic, which can then cause devastation on personal, societal, and worldwide scales.

### **[4. Housing Market in Melbourne, Australia](Housing_Market_in_Melbourne\ReadMe.md)**
Diverse research has shown that home ownership is positively related to one’s life satisfaction, via such factors as happiness, self-esteem and security (Dietz and Haurin, 2003). However, purchasing a home is also a very difficult decision, as it is one of the most expensive purchases that most people will make in their lifetime and it can lead to significant amounts of debt. In a time when the cost of living is continually rising in many areas of the world, it is increasingly important for people to make informed and economical decisions when purchasing a home.

### **[5. Emergency Calls](Emergency_Calls\ReadMe.md)**
Analysis of all Emergency Calls reported in the Montgomery County from 2015 to 2020. Usage of Pandas and Seaborn to showcase my findings, important insights were found like the Class of Incident that occurred more frequent, the time at where the incidents occurred the most, etc.
